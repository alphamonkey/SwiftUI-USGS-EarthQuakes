# SwiftUI-USGS-EarthQuakes

## Project Description
  SwiftUI-USGS-EarthQuakes is a native iOS app implementing a  client for the US Geological Survey's Earthquakes API (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/)  It displays a list of earthquakes near the user in descending order of magnitude.  Users can select an earthquake from the list to display its epicenter on a map and see additional details related to the event.  The purpose of this app is to demonstrate proficiency with the following technologies:
  * Mobile App Development
  * Native iOS Development
  * SwiftUI
  * MVVM
  * HTTP/JSON API Integration
  * MapKit
  * Core Location

  Future enhancements may include sorting by distance and event time, as well as a map-based alternative to the list view.
